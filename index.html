    <p>Cameras have lenses that focus light onto a sensor or film to create an image. People use photography to remember special times, like birthdays or holidays, and to share these memories with others. There are different types of photography like portraits, landscapes, and even photos of tiny things like bugs or flowers. Photographers use their creativity to make pictures interesting by choosing angles, lighting, and colors. Some pictures are black and white while others are bright and colorful. Editing tools can be used to make photos even better by adjusting brightness, contrast, or adding fun effects.</p>
